THIS CODE REQUIRES MMSP.

This directory contains MMSP code for phase field simulation of solidification, with coupled phase and heat equations.

Modeled after FiPy examples.phase.anisotropy.

Initialize: Customize parameters in initialize.cpp for dimensions, grid spacing, and undercooling, then make initialize. Run the program in terminal, with the wanted name for the file as the only other command line argument. If no name is input, the default name is solidification_data. Currently only implemented in 2D.

Simulate: Customize parameters in update.cpp for time step, angle relative to lab frame, degree of anisotropy, symmetry, gradient-energy coefficient, time normalization constant, k1, k2, and thermal diffusivity, then make simulate. Run the program in terminal, with the initial grid file as the first argument after the program, then the number of total time steps to simulate, then the increment at which grids will be output.
